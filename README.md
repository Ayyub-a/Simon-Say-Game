# Simon-Say-Game

This is a classic Simon Says game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to follow a series of randomly generated color patterns and replicate them in the same order. With each successful round, the sequence gets longer, and the game becomes increasingly challenging.

# Features:
Color Sequence Generation: The game generates a random sequence of colors that the player needs to follow.<br>
User Interaction: Players click on the colored buttons to replicate the sequence.<br>
Difficulty Progression: The length of the color sequence increases with each successful round, testing memory and concentration.<br>
Game Over: If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and the sequence resets.<br>

# Technologies Used:
HTML: Structure of the game, including buttons and layout.<br>
CSS: Styling for the game interface, animations, and color transitions.<br>
JavaScript: Logic for generating the random sequence, user input handling, and game progression.<br>

# How to Play:
Click the "Start" button to begin the game.<br>
Watch the color sequence appear.<br>
Click the buttons in the same order as shown in the sequence.<br>
The game continues as long as you correctly replicate the sequence.<br>
If you make a mistake, the game ends, and youâ€™ll see the final score.
